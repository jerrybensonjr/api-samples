# How To: Set Up a Postman Mock Server with Fixture Data

> **Portfolio Sample:** This tutorial was created by Jerry Benson to demonstrate step-by-step instructional documentation for API testing workflows. The goal is to teach how to set up a Postman Mock Server using sample JSON fixture files, making it accessible even to those new to Postman or API testing.

---

## Overview

A **Postman Mock Server** lets you simulate an API's behavior without connecting to the live endpoint. This is valuable when:

- The real API requires a paid subscription or limited free tier
- You need predictable, repeatable responses for testing
- The API is under development and not yet available
- You want to test error handling without triggering actual errors

This tutorial uses the OpenWeather Current Weather API as a practical example. By the end, you will be able to:

- Create a Postman collection and organize requests
- Add multiple example responses (success and error cases) using fixture files
- Configure and deploy a mock server
- Test different response scenarios using mock response headers

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner-friendly (no coding required)

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Free [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) account (desktop app recommended, web version also works)
- The five fixture JSON files from this repository (see [Understanding Fixture Files](#understanding-fixture-files))

**Helpful Context:**

- Basic familiarity with REST APIs and HTTP status codes
- Understanding of JSON structure (but no editing required)

**Related Documentation:**

- [OpenWeather Current Weather API Documentation](../openweather-current-weather-api.md) - The API we're mocking in this tutorial

---

## Workflow Overview

Here's the complete journey we'll follow:

### Collection â†’ Request â†’ Examples â†’ Mock Server â†’ Testing

1. Create a collection to organize your work
2. Add a request representing the API endpoint
3. Attach example responses from fixture files
4. Deploy a mock server to serve those examples
5. Test different scenarios using mock headers

---

## Understanding Fixture Files

**Fixture files** are sample JSON responses that represent what a real API would return. They allow you to test your application's behavior without making actual API calls.

This tutorial uses five fixture files stored in `/fixtures/openweather/`. Here are the five core response types you'll simulate, from success to errors:

### 1. Success Response (`openweather-weather.json`)

```json
{
  "coord": {
    "lon": -93.7502,
    "lat": 32.5252
  },
  "weather": [
    {
      "id": 800,
      "main": "Clear",
      "description": "clear sky",
      "icon": "01d"
    }
  ],
  "main": {
    "temp": 75.2,
    "feels_like": 76.1,
    "temp_min": 73.0,
    "temp_max": 77.0,
    "pressure": 1013,
    "humidity": 60
  },
  "wind": {
    "speed": 5.75,
    "deg": 180,
    "gust": 8.5
  },
  "sys": {
    "country": "US",
    "sunrise": 1695630000,
    "sunset": 1695672000
  },
  "name": "Shreveport",
  "cod": 200
}
```

- Complete weather data for Shreveport, LA
- HTTP status: 200 OK
- Represents successful API response

### 2. Authentication Error (`openweather-401.json`)

```json
{
  "cod": 401,
  "message": "Invalid API key. Please see https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info."
}
```

- HTTP status: 401 Unauthorized
- Triggered when API key is missing or invalid

### 3. Not Found Error (`openweather-404.json`)

```json
{
  "cod": "404",
  "message": "city not found"
}
```

- HTTP status: 404 Not Found
- Triggered when requested city doesn't exist in database

### 4. Rate Limit Error (`openweather-429.json`)

```json
{
  "cod": 429,
  "message": "Your account has exceeded the rate limit. Please wait before making additional requests."
}
```

- HTTP status: 429 Too Many Requests
- Triggered when API rate limits are exceeded

### 5. Server Error (`openweather-500.json`)

```json
{
  "cod": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

- HTTP status: 500 Internal Server Error
- Triggered when API experiences server-side issues

**Why These Fixtures?**

These represent the five most common response scenarios documented in the [OpenWeather API Error Responses section](../openweather-current-weather-api.md#error-responses). Having fixtures for each lets you test how your application handles both success and failure cases.

---

## Step 1: Create a Collection

Collections in Postman organize related API requests. Think of them as folders for your API testing work.

**Instructions:**

1. Open Postman (desktop app or web)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Collections**
3. Click **+ (New Collection)** or press `Ctrl+N` (Windows) / `Cmd+N` (Mac)
4. Name the collection: `OpenWeather Mock`
5. Click **Create**

**Expected Outcome:**

The collection appears in your sidebar. If you don't see it, check that you clicked **Create** instead of closing the dialog.

</details>

---

## Step 2: Add a Request to the Collection

Now we'll create a single request that represents calling the OpenWeather API.

**Instructions:**

1. Click on your **OpenWeather Mock** collection to select it
2. Click **Add a request** (or use the three-dot menu â†’ Add Request)
3. Name the request: `GET Current Weather`
4. Set the HTTP method dropdown to **GET**
5. In the URL field, enter the endpoint path with query parameters:

   ```bash
   /data/2.5/weather?q=Shreveport,US&units=imperial&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

6. Click **Save**

**Expected Outcome:**

The request appears under your collection with the GET method badge. Note: We're using only the path (not full URL) because the mock server will provide the domain later.

</details>

---

## Step 3: Add Example Responses from Fixtures

Examples in Postman are saved responses that your mock server will return. We'll create five examplesâ€”one for each fixture file.

### Adding the 200 Success Example

**Instructions:**

1. With your **GET Current Weather** request open, click **Save â–¾** (dropdown arrow)
2. Select **Save as example**
3. Postman creates a new example and switches to the **Examples** tab
4. Open your `openweather-weather.json` file and copy its entire contents
5. In Postman's **Response Body** section, paste the JSON
6. Set **Status** dropdown to `200 OK`
7. Rename the example (click the example name at top): `200 Success - Shreveport`
8. Click **Save**

**Expected Outcome:**

The example appears in the Examples tab with status 200. If the JSON looks malformed, Postman will highlight syntax errors in redâ€”check you copied the complete file.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“¸ Click to view screenshot</summary>

![Saving the first example response](images/postman-mock/03-add-example-200.png)

</details>

### Adding Error Response Examples

Repeat the process above for each error fixture:

| Fixture File | Status Code | Example Name |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `openweather-401.json` | `401 Unauthorized` | `401 Invalid API Key` |
| `openweather-404.json` | `404 Not Found` | `404 City Not Found` |
| `openweather-429.json` | `429 Too Many Requests` | `429 Rate Limit Exceeded` |
| `openweather-500.json` | `500 Internal Server Error` | `500 Server Error` |

**Expected Outcome:**

Your Examples tab shows all five examples with their respective status codes. If you're missing any, go back and repeat the "Save as example" process.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“¸ Click to view screenshot</summary>

![All five examples added to the request](images/postman-mock/04-all-examples.png)

</details>

---

## Step 4: Create the Mock Server

Now we'll deploy a mock server that serves these example responses.

**Instructions:**

1. Click **New** in the top-left corner of Postman
2. Select **Mock Server**
3. In the dialog:
   - **Select collection:** Choose `OpenWeather Mock`
   - **Mock server name:** Enter `OpenWeather Mock Server`
   - **Environment:** Leave as "No Environment"
   - **Save mock URL as environment variable:** (Optional)
4. Click **Create Mock Server**
5. Postman generates a mock URL (format: `https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.mock.pstmn.io`)
6. **Copy this URL** â€” you'll need it for testing

**Expected Outcome:**

A success message appears with your mock server URL. Save this URL immediatelyâ€”you can also find it later in **Mock Servers** (left sidebar), but it's easier to copy it now.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“¸ Click to view screenshot</summary>

![Mock server creation dialog](images/postman-mock/05-create-mock-server.png)

</details>

---

## Step 5: Test the Default Mock Response

Let's verify the mock server works by sending a basic request.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a **new request** (outside your collection, or in a separate test collection)
2. Set method to **GET**
3. Enter the full mock URL with the path:

   ```http
   https://YOUR-MOCK-ID.mock.pstmn.io/data/2.5/weather?q=Shreveport,US&units=imperial&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

4. Click **Send**

**Expected Outcome:**

You receive the 200 Success JSON response. Postman's mock server returns the first matching example by default.

**Important:** If you get a 404 error *about the mock server itself* (not the fixture), this is different from the 404 City Not Found fixture. A mock server 404 means Postman can't find your mockâ€”verify your URL matches the one from Step 4.

</details>

---

## Step 6: Force Specific Response Codes

Mock servers can return different examples based on custom headers. This lets you test error handling without modifying your request URL.

### Using `x-mock-response-code`

**Instructions:**

1. In your test request, go to the **Headers** tab
2. Add a new header:
   - **Key:** `x-mock-response-code`
   - **Value:** `401`
3. Ensure the header checkbox is enabled
4. Click **Send**

**Expected Outcome:**

You now receive the 401 error response from `openweather-401.json`. If you still get 200, check the header is enabled (checkbox) and spelled correctly.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“¸ Click to view screenshot</summary>

![Adding x-mock-response-code header](images/postman-mock/07-header-response-code.png)

</details>

**Try These Values:**

| Header Value | Expected Response |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `401` | Invalid API Key error |
| `404` | City Not Found error |
| `429` | Rate Limit Exceeded error |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |
| (remove header) | Returns default 200 success |

### Using `x-mock-response-name` (Alternative Method)

You can also target examples by their exact name:

**Instructions:**

1. Remove the `x-mock-response-code` header
2. Add a new header:
   - **Key:** `x-mock-response-name`
   - **Value:** `404 City Not Found` (exact example name)
3. Click **Send**

**Expected Outcome:**

Returns the specific example matching that name, regardless of status code. This is useful when you have multiple examples with the same status code.

## Step 7: Verify All Response Scenarios

To ensure your mock server is production-ready, test each scenario:

**Test Checklist:**

- [ ] **200 Success:** Send request without mock headers â†’ Verify JSON matches `openweather-weather.json`
- [ ] **401 Error:** Add `x-mock-response-code: 401` â†’ Verify authentication error message
- [ ] **404 Error:** Add `x-mock-response-code: 404` â†’ Verify city not found message
- [ ] **429 Error:** Add `x-mock-response-code: 429` â†’ Verify rate limit message
- [ ] **500 Error:** Add `x-mock-response-code: 500` â†’ Verify server error message

**Expected Outcome:**

All five scenarios return the correct JSON response with appropriate status codes. If any fail, revisit Step 3 to ensure examples were saved with the correct status codes.

## Troubleshooting

### Mock Server Returns 404 Not Found (Mock Not Found)

**Problem:** Request to mock URL returns an error about the mock itself not existing.

**Solutions:**

- Verify your mock URL is correct (check **Mock Servers** in left sidebar)
- Ensure the endpoint path matches exactly what's in your collection request (case-sensitive)
- Confirm the mock server is still active (they don't expire, but can be deleted)

### Headers Not Working in Testing

**Problem:** Adding headers doesn't change mock behavior.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure headers are enabled (checkbox in Headers tab)
- Verify you're testing with a NEW request, not the one inside your mock collection
- Try both `x-mock-response-code` and `x-mock-response-name` methods
- Check for typos in header keys (they are case-sensitive)

### Mock Server Always Returns Same Response

**Problem:** Changing `x-mock-response-code` header doesn't change the response.

**Solutions:**

- Check header spelling: must be exactly `x-mock-response-code`
- Verify the status code exists in your examples (e.g., you created a 401 example)
- Ensure the header checkbox is enabled in the Headers tab
- Clear any cached responses: **Settings** â†’ **Data** â†’ **Clear Postman Data**

### Response Body Is Empty or Incorrect

**Problem:** Mock returns a response but the JSON is wrong or missing.

**Solutions:**

- Go to your collection â†’ **Examples** tab â†’ verify JSON is present in Response Body
- Confirm you pasted the complete fixture file contents
- Check for JSON syntax errors (Postman highlights these in red)
- Re-save the example after making corrections

### Can't Find Mock Server URL

**Problem:** You closed the creation dialog and lost the URL.

**Solutions:**

- Click **Mock Servers** in left sidebar
- Find your mock server name
- Click on it to view the URL
- Copy the base URL from the details panel

## Use Cases and Next Steps

### When to Use Mock Servers

**Portfolio/Learning:**

- Practice API integration without needing paid API keys
- Demonstrate testing skills to recruiters
- Create repeatable examples for documentation screenshots

**Development:**

- Frontend development while backend APIs are being built
- Testing error handling logic without triggering real errors
- Isolating API behavior from external dependencies

**Team Collaboration:**

- Share consistent test data across team members
- Document expected API responses in a runnable format
- Onboard new developers with working examples

### Extending This Setup

**Add More Fixtures:**

- Create fixtures for different cities (e.g., `openweather-newyork.json`)
- Add fixtures for different weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.)
- Include edge cases (empty responses, unusual data)

**Create Fixtures for Other APIs:**

This same process works for any REST API. Apply it to other APIs in this portfolio:

1. Make a real API call (or find example responses in documentation)
2. Save the JSON response as a fixture file
3. Follow Steps 1-4 to create collection, examples, and mock server
4. Test different scenarios with mock headers

**See these portfolio samples for examples:**

- [NASA APOD API Documentation](../nasa-apod-api.md)
- [NASA Mars Rover Photos API Documentation](../nasa-mars-rover-api.md)
- [REST Countries API Documentation](../rest-countries-api.md)

**Integrate with Applications:**

- Use mock URLs in development environment configuration
- Write integration tests against the mock server
- Create automated test suites using Postman's Collection Runner
