This repository is my hands-on training ground for building API documentation in **Markdown** using tools like Postman, GitHub, and VS Code.  

Each project is a practice exercise toward becoming proficient in technical writing for developer and API docs.

## About This Repo
This repo is structured as a **practice portfolio**, not production code.
